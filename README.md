For increased security, this project offers an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) that uses a card checking framework in conjunction with an OTP password framework (created using Elliptical curve cryptography (ECC), which is a public key encryption approach) delivered through SMS As a result it combines ATM card scanning with an OTP. The customer can inspect his card and log into the system using a second OTP, according to this system. 
At this point, the framework generates and transmits a One-time Password (OTP) to the client's enrolled cell phone number. The client's bank account must be linked to this phone number. To withdraw cash, he must now input the OTP into the system. As a result, our system provides a highly safe method of performing ATM transactions, with a two-level security structure.
The One time Password supplied to the client is encrypted while transmitted from the bank's database and only decrypted when received by the client, according to the system structure described above. Anyone between the bank and the account holder will no longer be able to intercept the OTP.
